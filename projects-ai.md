## Headline Hero game

Based on an idea from Jeff Su and [Guidelines for Creating Effective Headings and URLs for End-User Documentation](https://firehead.net/free-resource/guidelines-for-creating-effective-headings-and-urls-for-end-user-documentation/) (a free PDF resource from Firehead), I used Google Gemini to turn it into a learning game to teach the team guidelines for creating 
effective headings and URLs. It all took less than 30 minutes to do.
